# Speakers
Bob Rossi and Dave Lotti did most of the speaking

# Grades Matter!
* There are only a few things to get you on a list, but a thousand things to get you crossed off
* Academics is the ticket and GPA is very important
* GPA is difficult to bring up late, so start your best from freshman year

# College Communications
* Never too early to start writing schools
* Freshman/Softmore keep a big list of schools (50 or more at all divisions)
* Don't focus on a single division or conference
* Into letter subject... Mention Rhode Island Thunder Gold w/coach's name and change it up, don't all use the same one
* Name, position, year of grad and fall schedule with link to tourny website
* Send 6 follow up letters
* Include link to video which should be less than 2 minutes
* Send Thank you letters to coaches that come to game
* Don't write a D1 until they can legally come see you (Oct 20,21)
* Find a way to stand out in your emails
* Read the coaches bio... Recognize milestone, big wins, etc.
* Same for asst coaches. Show then you're paying attention and care

# College Camps
* All camp invitations should be run through your coach, especially if it is not local. Some are just revenue makers
* Thunder coaches can reach out ahead of time to camp coaches to alerts then if your attendance
* At camps, introduce yourself. Then say thank you at the end. Leave them with a good impression of yourself

# Do's and Don'ts
* **Do:** Be very very careful what you put on social media. If Gramma would be embarrassed, don't post it.
* **Do:** talk, communicate, be loud on the field. Be a coach on the field
* **Do:** How do you handle failure? Handle it with grace, be positive. 
* **Do:** Behave at hotels, somebody maybe spying on you and watching your behavior
* **Do:** Try to visit schools near the tourney when you're traveling
* **Do:** Neatly hang Helmets and bags at games
* **Do:** Keep uniforms neat and tucked in when worn and folded neatly when not worn

* **Don't:** be negative
* **Don't:** Wear any college apparel or gear from a college that you're not already committed to

# Parents
* Parents should be team parents, and not focus too much on their kid. Be a party a college would like to have in the stands
* Parents should not critique their kid during our after the game. Keep it private (at the hotel room)
* Parents should be as positive as possible with everyone (players coaches and other parents)
