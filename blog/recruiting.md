## Introduction
* You can reach out to your coach, Bob Rossi or Dave Lotti with any questions
* There are only a few things to get you on a list, but a thousand things to get you crossed off
* Strong academics is the ticket
* Student GPA is very important and very difficult to bring up late, so start your best from freshman year.

## Writing to Colleges
* Never too early to start writing schools
* Freshman/Softmore keep a big list of schools (50 or more at all divisions)
* Don't focus on a single division or conference
* In your Intro letters include in the subject 'Rhode Island Thunder Gold <coach's name>'
* Change it up, don't all use the letter for every school
* Include your name, position, year of graduation and fall schedule with a link to the tournament website
* Send 6 follow up letters
* Include link to video which should be less than 2 minutes
* Send Thank you letters to coaches that come to game
* Don't write a D1 until they can legally come see you (Oct 20,21)
* Find a way to stand it in your emails
* Read the coaches bio... Recognize milestone, big wins, etc.
* Same for asst coaches. Show then you're paying attention and care

## College Camps
* All camp invitations should be run through your coach, especially if it is not local
* Some are just revenue makers
* Thunder coaches can reach out ahead of time to camp coaches to alerts then if your attendance
* At camps, introduce yourself. Then say thank you at the end. Leave them with a good impression of yourself

## Do's & Don'ts
* **Do:** Be very very careful what you put on social media. If Gramma would be embarrassed, don't post it.
* **Do:** Talk, communicate, be loud on the field. Be a coach on the field
* **Do:** Handle failure with grace, be positive. How do you handle failure? 
* **Do:** Behave at hotels, somebody maybe watching your behavior
* **Do:** Try to visit schools near the tourney when you're traveling
* **Do:** Be neat, organized and disciplined. Helmets and bags are hung neatly
* **Do:** Respect your uniform. Uniforms are neat and tucked in when worn it folded neatly when not worn
* **Don't:** Be negative on or off the field
* **Don't:** Don't: Wear any college apparel or gear from a college that you're not already committed to

## Parents
* Parents should be team parents, and not focus too much on their kid. Be a parent a college would like to have in the stands
* Parents should not critique their kid during our after the game. Keep it private (at the hotel room)
* Parents should be as positive as possible with everyone (players, coaches and other parents)
