The Rhode Island Thunder has been around for over 20 years. It is a premier softball program that focuses on developing the players and helping them to land a position on a college softball team. The Thunder is a very disciplined orginiztion. Below are some tips for success with the Thunder, otherwise known as 'The Thunder Way'.

## Players
* There are no last names on jerseys. We play for the team, not the player.
* Always wear uniform with respect.
* You are always representing Thunder from the time you leave your hotel room until the time you get back. College coaches will be staying at the same hotel as you.
* Shirts should be tucked in, always.
* Easy to get crossed off a college list, so behave.
* Interaction with everyone is critical, including parents, coaches, umps, everyone.
* No wearing Thunder gear at any other team (high school, etc.)
* Blue, White, Columbia colors are the only acceptable colors for extras (headbands, etc.)
* Don't wear anything from a college you have not committed to! A prospective college coach may think you've committed.
* Be extremely careful what you put on social media. 
* Scholarships are year to year so behave because it could be pulled.
* Softball bags always need to be lined up, when on the ground or on the fence.
* Follow the 'Thunder Way' (disciplined)
* Eye contact is important, with coaches, and anyone else you interact with.
* Always be 100% focused on your coach. For example, during the post-game talk from the coach don't look at the grass or play with your shoe laces, even if you are listening. Eye contact is important so people know you are paying attention and interested.

## Parents
* Once girl is taken by team on game day, no interaction with parents. This means the players don't call to their parents for a bottle of water, and parents stay away from the dugout.
* Parents' behavior is noticed! Don't ruin an opportunity for you child.
* Girls should not be looking at parents during game for approval, or worry when they make a mistake.
* Parents, don't post about your kid's successes... Team!
* Don't repost everything your favorite college posts.
